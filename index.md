Thanks for stopping by. I created this blog as an outlet for stuff I want to write. I've been working as a lead instructor at DevStation, which is a Powered by Code Fellows code school. I teach ful-stack software developement with NodeJs. 

I created this site mainly to laugh at myself in the future... ha...hahahaha!
