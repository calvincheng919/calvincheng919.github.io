Thanks for stopping by. Not sure why you're here, perhaps a wrong turn at the fork in the interweb road or you want to be completely bored with my 100 Days of Code journal. I created this site to track my progress going through the 100DaysOfCode Challenge. You can read more about the challenge and what it entails [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/). 

My hundred days will be focussed on building applications with ReactJS. I took a class at the University of Washington Continuing Education last year and built a React app as a capstone project, but felt it was rushed, and only satisfied the minimum viable product requirements. Having some basic React knowledge now, I want to re-factor (essentially re-coding) my UW project, and then move on to other projects within the Front-end certification section of [Freecodecamp](http://freecodecamp.com). 

My time will be split between freecodecamp and project work, with at least an hour spent on project work everyday, for one hundred days.
