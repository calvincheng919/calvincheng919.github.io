Thanks for stopping by. I created this blog to track my software development journey as a life-long learner and professional. The short of it is that after a 20+ year career in information technology, with roles ranging from network admin, technical instructor, to BI developer, and sr. analytics manager at Amazon, I retired. Retirement didn't take, so I went back to my first love... coding. The landscape of the modern web and software development had obviously changed. I wanted to see if I could do it, make it as a software developer. 

Most everything I write in this blog is either geared toward my future self's learning and understanding, or for the highschool coding class I teach.
