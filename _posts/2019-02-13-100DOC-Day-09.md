**Excerpt**: Trying to resolve an issue I'm having and posted my first question on Stackoverflow! 

**Today's Progress**: Seems to be a logic issue with my form. I have my submit button disabled and want it enabled on when all the fields are filled in. Seems to work okay using && to return a boolean, by chaining all of the states together that are required. However, for some reason, on it only disables on the second letter/number I enter on the last box. I would have expected the very moment I entered a value... for that matter any order of entry should enable the button on the very last item to be entered. Doesn't make sense to me and I suspect I have a logic gap.

Here is a link to the Stackoverflow Question: [Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54682278/using-logical-operators-to-conditionally-enable-disable-button-element)

So yes, I did figure out and resolve the issue. Onward with completing rudimentary form validation. 

**Thoughts**: Shit always take longer than I planned.
