**Excerpt**: Working on my summary page with summation of portfolio performance

**Today's Progress**: Super slow day code-wise. I am creating the child components to feed in to the summary page, consisting of a summary of profit/loss among other things. Things are proving a bit slow as I've had to re-learn how to use the little Firebase I did learn when I built the application. Firebase is the Google real time database, using OAuth2 - you can essentially designate a provider (Google, FB, Github, email/pw, etc...). Firebase re-directs you to be authenticated by one of the providers, then your react app is given a token without ever needing to know the user's credentials. 

**Thoughts**: None at the moment. Going to bed.
