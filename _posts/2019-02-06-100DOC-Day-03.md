**Today's Progress**: Continue working to get OptionsTracker working. Created a new create-react-app and copied all files
over to the new directory. I git cloned the repo initially, but ran into issues when starting the app. I could not resolve
the issues (I'm sure I was doing something wrong), so decided that the best way was to copy/paste code from my old app into "new" files, and resolve errors/missing modules as I npm start the app. One thing that I'm running into is Google Firebase issues. Turns out I have some local environment variables (i.e., my API key) that are local... on another machine. I'll have to get them once I'm home (I"m currently away). I recall being told that I should not git commit api keys as they present a security risk, especially repos being public and all :-)

**Thoughts**: Sucks being away from this app for such a long time. In fact, this is kind of a case in point for regular coding.
