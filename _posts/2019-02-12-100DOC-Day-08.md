**Excerpt**: Working on stock option input form

**Today's Progress**: Stuck on enabling/disabling button based on whether data exists in the input fields. It's easy enough to conditionally turn them on/off, but when I use && operators to return a true/false based on multiple fields having values, the behavior is not right. Console log returns the correct boolean state but button response doesn't make sense. I will continue to work on this. I must be missing something. 

**Thoughts**: Not really any today.
