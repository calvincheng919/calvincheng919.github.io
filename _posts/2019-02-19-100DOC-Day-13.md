**Excerpt**: Combining two days into one post. Productive two days.

**Today's Progress**: Felt really good, although I did not feel good when I was banging my head against the wall thinking I was stupid. Trying to figure out how to do hover/click highlighting of a reactstrap Container took a little doing. At the end it was really just an exercise in passing a key, some css and conditionally (based on the key) displaying each column, making it look like a single row is lite. I will do a commit/merge/build in a couple of days if you really want to see it. I will also comment my code. This 'simple' feature took me a bloody long time!

**Thoughts**: Learning a new language and process is super difficult. Also, I think I'm going to create a react environment from scratch instead of using the handy create-react-app. This will give me a clue as to what all goes into the scafolding of a ReactJS application. Stay tuned.
