**Excerpt**: Happy Valentine's Day. Learned a few things today and made a couple of decisions. 

**Today's Progress**: Validation is not quite complete but it is good for now. Moved on to a little feature that's been bugging me. I am currently displaying all the trades entered into the applicaiton and giving the ability to edit by clicking any row. What I would like to do is to indicate the row being edited, i.e., highlighting the row a different color. Also would like to change color of the row by hovering. I may have to convert the reactstrap layout (Col/Row) to tables instead, to be able to take advantage of 'hover'. indicating the row currently being edited still presents a bit of a challenge for a newbie like me. 

**Thoughts**: I would love to be able to get to a point when I can simple write code without a crap load of research and testing. I know this is because of unfamiliarity, and liken it to a person learning to new verbal language. You have to learn the alphabet, and have the ability to construct sentences before you're able to be creative. We'll get there.
