**Excerpt**: Created Reactstrap modal forms and converted most of my alerts to modals.

**Today's Progress**: Continuing validation of form fields. Also started working thorugh the D3.js section of freecodecamp. Converted alerts to modal forms. Thought of a few more features/enhancements/modifications to add:

* Signin/signout currently caches the most recent google id, I need to make it prompt for a new google id
* Bulk upload feature - ability to choose a csv or Excel/Google Sheets file
* In addition to validation, the submit button should be disabled until required fields are filled in

**Thoughts**: Other project ideas:

* TV/Movie App
* Ice
