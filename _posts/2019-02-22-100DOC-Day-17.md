**Excerpt**: Resolved Firebase access issue, but a small auth state persistence problem remains

**Today's Progress**: Working on Firebase today. Was able to get connectivity issue resolved and the component is retrieving data from Firebase, and I am able to pass the data object to the child component. Also got re-acquinted with the Object.keys(myObject) function, which returns an array of 'keys', as in key/value key. Very useful function you can apply to any object that has properties (keys). So yeah, still a bit of work to create performance summaries out of the raw data. Also an auth state persistence problem - I am able to get the permanent, session, none to function, but when user signs out, and then sign-in, the window pops up, but does not give an option to sign-in as a different user. I know it's a parameter/setting but have not been able to find it yet. 

**Thoughts**: Having a drink!
