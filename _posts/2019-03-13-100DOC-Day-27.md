**Excerpt**: 7 days without (not quite) coding but I am back to it. I do, however, have a great excuse! Read on...

**Today's Progress**: I've been super busy lately as a code bootcamp teaching assistant! Central Oregon Community College started a code bootcamp last year, in partnership with Code Fellows out of Seattle (Code Fellows provides the curriculum and methodology). A member of BendJS Meetup group (actually founder of the group), who turned out to be the lead instructor, was looking for help with this second bootcamp cohort and I answered the call! Adult education is something I've always enjoyed doing. 

Beyond the exercises in class as well as grading code exercises from these eager and kick-butt students from all walks of life and diversity, I've finally had a chance to go back to my own project, the Options Tracker. Still working on performance charting using Recharts, a React/D3 library.

**Thoughts**: I'm looking forward to learning and teaching and am totally humbled by the opportunity. Seeing students of such wide ranging ages and backgrounds is crazy cool, and knowing by the end of this 20 weeks these folks are going to have their lives changed is awesome!
