**Excerpt**: This is a long one. Continuing to work on Summary component, and screwing around with CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid and researching resources to crack this bloody CSS nut.

**Today's Progress**: Have been wanting to solidify some CSS crap that's been bugging me. Namely, how to use Flexbox and CSS Grid. Yes, I've done the FCC challenges, but didn't really stick. Found a couple of games - [flexboxfroggy.com](http://flexboxfroggy.com) and [gridgarden.com](http://gridgarden.com). 

Summary and child component Overallperf is not quite working right now and will need a bit more work. 

**Thoughts**: Still working on my React App and moving forward. I still plan on completing it by the end of the month, which is in a few days. I did, however, get side-tracked today on CSS. CSS is somewhat of a mystery to me, no matter how many tutorials I do and how much I read about it. Don't get me wrong, I've worked with CSS on and off for many years and have no problem with syntax and the like. Nothing, however, seems to want to stick. I can't just sit down and bash out a layout without looking up, researching, refreshing, trial and error. That's bugged me enough that I did a more serious research on resources to follow-up on. The two above are ones that stood out to me because it is so hands-on. Here's a list of additional resources:

* Again, [FreeCodeCamp's](http://freecodecamp.com) CSS and responsive section is great as one resource
* repeat from above, [flexboxfroggy.com](http://flexboxfroggy.com)
* repeat from above, [gridgarden.com](http://gridgarden.com)
* [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com/) - Rachel Andrew's site kicks butt! Videos, tutorials, templates.
* [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) - of course CSS-Tricks. These guys are awesome. They have a bunch of tutorials and templates. 
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) You can't forget about W3Schools. There is a whole section and more on CSS as well as templates and code snippets. The fundamentals are definitely here. 

One last note: The thing that is so confusing about CSS is that there's so many ways to do the same thing. I wish there was a best practice to accomplish x or never do y. It is, for the most part by trial and error and you find your own way. I have, however, started to Google search CSS best practices. The issue is determing all the "whys".
