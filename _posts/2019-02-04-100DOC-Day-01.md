### Day 1

**Today's Progress**: Cloned my OptionsTracker repo locally and made sure everything "worked". It has been several months since I've looked at this project and since then there has been several low to high priority security vulnerabilities I need to attend to. Once I resolve these, I should be able to run npm start and have the dev server kick up with my Options Tracker app.

**Thoughts**: One thing that isn't talked about much when you start to code in the "modern" environment is all the crap you have to know other-than the language/framework you're working in. For instance, Git is one big ass tool you need to learn, and I've only scratched the surface. I'm currently using create-react-app, but the scaffolding behind the scene is obscene. Just setting up VS Code can be daunting. My point is, the ancillary hoops and knowledge you have to pick up is an experience in itself, which is something freecodecamp is a bit skinny on.
