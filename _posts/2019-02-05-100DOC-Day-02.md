**Today's Progress**: Spent the last hour and a half trying to replicate my now non-working UW final project OptionsTracker.
I may have to re-code the entire thing from scratch. Today's session was somewhat unproductive. Did not create new code nor 
did I solve any problems. 

**Thoughts**: Shit always takes longer than you think.
