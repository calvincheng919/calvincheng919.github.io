**Excerpt**: Worked on Personal Portfolio some more today and am ~80% done

**Today's Progress**: Not many projects to put on my personal portfolio, I guess this is why I'm doing this #100DaysOfCode. Well, I continued to work on that personal page. It is currently on [https://codepen.io](Codepen), but once I'm done I will get it hosted. I promise I will get back to my project.

**Thoughts**: Not many.
