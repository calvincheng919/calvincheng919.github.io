**Excerpt**: Missed a couple of days but back at it again. Made some good progress with my aggregate calcs in Options Tracker

**Today's Progress**: Writing the functions to aggregate all of the options trades is tedious. I'm really enjoying working with the array functions filter(), map(), reduce(). These are such powerful functions for handling data. In fact, if you've ever read anything about Big Data, what you are doing with mapping and reducing in arrays is essentially the same (I have a very rudimentary understanding of Big Data). Anyway, I've been thinking about the next step once these functions are done, and that is to apply some kind of visualiztion. I mentioned in a previous post that I want to use recharts, which uses D3 in conjunction with React. But I'm looking at the available libraries and am a bit confused by so many options. I guess I'll just have to choose one work with it.
