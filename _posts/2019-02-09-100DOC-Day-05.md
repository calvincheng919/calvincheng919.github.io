**Excerpt**: Working on form validation in React

**Today's Progress**: There's no easy way to do form validation in React. I know there are libraries but I've decided to do the validation manually. I may change my mind after repeating my code too much. There's also a Medium post I'm reading regarding that very topic. I'll have to study it a bit further, but for now I'm just writing it myself and practicing code. 

**Thoughts**: A few great  resources I want to share. These have helped tremendously in understanding JS concepts:

* Free eBook: [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/). You can also buy the paperback version on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2TFnN91) - disclosure, this is an affiliate link.
* [The Modern Javascript Tutorial](http://javascript.info/)
* [JavaScript is Sexy](https://javascriptissexy.com/)
