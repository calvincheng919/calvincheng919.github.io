**Excerpt**: Decided to take a break from my project and build a React environment without create-react-app. Fun!

**Today's Progress**: As the excerpt says, built a React Prod/Dev environment without create-react-app. This has been on my to-do for some time now. 

**Thoughts**: Ever since I was introduced to ReactJS at the UW Continuing Education, and the instructor talked about how easy it is to simply use create-react-app to avoid having to create all the scafolding for React... Thought to myself, wait... this is the lite version. In the real world, wouldn't it be beneficial to know how to do that? I completely understand that for the sake of brevity and time constraints, create-react-app is a great package to get going and learn ReactJS, but there's a lot more to JS than just JS. Likewise, there's a lot more to ReactJS. I only scratched the surface, but built a React environment with Webpack, Babel and associated loaders. I don't profess to understand what every piece means, and certainly will need to deep dive into them... perhaps another dedicated 'Newbie take on building React Environment from scratch'.
