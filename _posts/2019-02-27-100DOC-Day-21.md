**Excerpt**: Back to my Options Tracker project in React. Continuing to build Summary component. Also completed FCC Responsive Web Cert. 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Responsive Web cert on FreeCodeCamp with the completion of personal portfolio. Will put a link up as soon as I've polished up a bit more as well as finish (as far as possible) this Options Tracker React App. The Summary component of the Options Tracker project requires several functions to be written that summarizes all the trades. This is essentially an exercise in Array map(), reduce() and filter(). These are tricky at first to work with, but pretty slick once you get the hang of them. 

**Thoughts**: I once owned a motorcycle.
