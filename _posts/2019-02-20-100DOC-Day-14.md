**Excerpt**: Working down the feature list of my app and fixing issues.

**Today's Progress**: Completed Hover/Click functionality and moving on to the Summary/Performance page of my app. I started to write the Performance component in React and decided to use the Reacstrap Table component instead of Reactstrap Container component like I did on the Puts/Calls page/component. Next task is to pass all of the data from the Puts/Calls compoent (which has state), to the Performance compoonent, do some math and create summaries, as well as by month/year view of performance. I also want to get rudimentary charts/graphs and have decided to use Recharts library, which supposedly works well with ReactJS. But another day...


**Thoughts**: Good progress today. Going to move on to my company website. Need to create a simple web presence.
