**Excerpt**: Days 23-26. Missed a day in here and also aggregated my posts for several days. I'm away on the road and things are a bit irregular right now. Life's happening, but am glad I only missed a day of coding. 

**Today's Progress**: Good news, finished all my aggregate calc functions for the performance summary page. I know I mentioned I was going to update the committs on GitHub, but I have not. The app is still the old, pre-100days version. I will update next week. Onward to graphing and charting my performance with Recharts or some kind of D3/React library.

**Thoughts**: Again, things always take longer than you think... such is life.
