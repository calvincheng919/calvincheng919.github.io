**Today's Progress**: Today is setup day. Setting up this blog on GH Pages, learning some rudimentary markdown, finish setting up VS Code and my development environment on my MAC. 

**Thoughts**: I've been doing all my previous coding on a PC, including UW Continuing Ed's JS course. Using a Macbook Pro will be different, and learning to use Bash will be very interesting as well. Please see [About](about.md) for more on my background and where I am starting from at Day 00.
