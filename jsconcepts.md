[Home](https://calvincheng.dev)

As I learn concepts, I need to re-enforce what I learn by doing several things. Everyone learns differently, and over the years I've come to understand that for me, writing down what I've learned in my own words really helps me solidify the concepts. In addition, if I can come up with a solid example, it makes it "stick" like heck. This section is really for my own accounting and reference. My future self will thank me for explaining these concepts to me in my own words. If you find it helpful from my perspective, great!!
