title: About

Hello, as I'm sure no one actually reads any of this, the "About" section is also just for my own enjoyment... maybe. Who gives a shit. Anyway, this is me.

I live in Bend, OR and love to mountain bike and ski. Whitewater kayaking used to be a sport I enjoy, but the waters around here are really, really hard to paddle (class 4/5), unless you go to the Bend Water Park. Besides, my shoulder is messed up. My wife and I moved here from Seattle in the Spring of 2018. We both quit our corporate jobs - her from Costco, as a BI Analyst and me, completely burned out by Amazon Web Services. I'd worked at Amazon for close to 10 years, and decided I was done. So, we both quit our jobs, put our Seattle house up for rental (I'm crazy, but not stupid enough to sell...yet) and moved to Bend. 

**Why Am I Doing The 100DaysOfCode Challenge?**

I started my IT career back in 1999, first as a Network Administrator, and then teaching VB, Java, OOAP and basic web (HTML/CSS) at a now defunct technology school (Information Technology Institute). I've never had a "real" dev job like I imagined so long ago. As the economy slowly recovered from the dotcom crash of the early 2000's, I found myself working for a BI (Business Intelligence) company called Cognos, first as a technical instructor, and then as a consultant implementing BI and datawarehouse solutions to a myriad of companies. Eventually, I got tired of the road and settled down in Seattle to work for Amazon (read more about my time at Amazon and what I did there, as well as what I'm currently doing, on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/calvincheng/). After close to 10 years with Amazon, my wife and I called it quits from the corporate world and moved to Bend, OR. With a tiny nest egg, we decided to take some time off and enjoy each other, family and life.  

In the meantime, however, I'd never stopped being interested in technology and how crap on the web worked. I self-studied, took courses and generally messed around online for my own edification. Now that I'm not "working" fulltime, I have time to really dive into some of these topics... and who knows, maybe I can parlay it into a second career or a business. It's always kinda bugged me that I never became a dev. So during this 100 days, I'm going to build, and not just walk through endless tutorials.
