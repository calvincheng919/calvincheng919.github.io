Hello, as I'm sure no one actually reads any of this, the "About" section is also just for my own enjoyment... maybe. Who gives a shit. Anyway, this is me.

I live in Bend, OR and love to mountain bike and ski. Whitewater kayaking used to be a sport I enjoy, but the waters around here are really, really hard to paddle, unless you go to the Bend Water Park. Besides, my shoulder is messed up. My wife and I moved here from Seattle in the Spring of 2018. We both quit our corporate jobs - her from Costco, as a BI Analyst and me, completely burned out by Amazon Web Services. I'd worked at Amazon for close to 10 years, and decided I was done. So, we both quit our jobs, put our Seattle house up for rental (I'm crazy, but not stupid enough to sell...yet) and moved to Bend.
